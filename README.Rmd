To install the package, use the following code.


```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("learnr","car","lsr","ggplot2","car","ezANOVA","BayesFactor","MBESS")
library(devtools)  
install_github("chrisaberson/ANOVATutorials")  
```

To run a tutorial, use this code. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(learnr)  
run_tutorial("ttest", package = "ANOVATutorials")

```



After you run this code, the tutorial will open in a tab on your browser. 

If this doesn't work, you likely need to update your rtools. Go to  https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ and download the most recent version (for your platform (Note: Rtools is just for Windows, I am looking into other platforms). You may also, on Mac OS have to install the backports package.
