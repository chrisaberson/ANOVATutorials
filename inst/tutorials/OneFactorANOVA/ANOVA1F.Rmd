## Exercise 4

The code below demonstrates how to run a one factor ANOVA using a dataset called *xx* with variables *group* and *x*. These are the values you used earlier for hand calculations. The first command runs the ANOVA and captures it in an object called ex1. The `lsr::etasquared` command uses the object that holds the ANOVA results. Next, I demonstrate the `DescTools` and `multcomp` for multiple comparisons and also demonstrate orthogonal contrasts. Please note that you typically would select only one method for comparisons. 

Notes: `lsr` is fussy. If the variables are not factor and numeric, you will get an error. `multcomp` also has some fussiness that I'll get into below. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
ex1<-aov(xx$x~xx$group)
summary(ex1)
lsr::etaSquared(ex1)
tapply(xx$x, xx$group, mean)
tapply(xx$x, xx$group, sd)
```

### Exercise

Using the *covid1F* data, examine social distancing behaviors (**SD**) by intervention (**group**). The intervention conditions are Personalized Normative Influence (PNF) - participation give an estimate of % of people that engage in social distancing, they are then given an estimate that is larger than theirs as an indication of the prevalence. Direct Normative Theory 1 – Participants who give an answer of less than 50% received feedback on the positive aspects of those who practice social distancing. Those who give an answer of less than 50% receive feedback on the negative aspect of those who do not practice distancing. Direct Normative Theory 2 – Same as DRT1 but based on answer to a 1-8 scale. Control received no intervention. 

Be sure to get an effect size and descriptive statistics.

```{r ex1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```

```{r ex1-solution}
ex1<-aov(covid1F$SD~covid1F$group)
summary(ex1)
lsr::etaSquared(ex1)
tapply(covid1F$SD,covid1F$group, mean)
tapply(covid1F$SD,covid1F$group, sd)
```

## Quiz
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
ex1<-aov(covid1F$SD~covid1F$group)
summary(ex1)
lsr::etaSquared(ex1)
tapply(covid1F$SD,covid1F$group, mean)
tapply(covid1F$SD,covid1F$group, sd)
```


```{r quiz5, ECHO=F}
learnr::quiz(
  learnr::question("What is your conclusion about the null hypothesis based on these results? ",
    learnr::answer("Reject"),
    learnr::answer("Accept"),
    learnr::answer("Fail to Reject", correct = TRUE),
    learnr::answer("To little information to decide"),  
    correct = "Correct!" ,
    incorrect = "Sorry, that is incorrect. Try again.",
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = T
),
  learnr::question("What does this conclusion mean in plain English",
    learnr::answer("The interventions worked"),
    learnr::answer("The interventions do not seem related to social distancing behaviors", correct = TRUE),
    learnr::answer("People who participated in an intervention distanced more"),
    learnr::answer("People who participated in an intervention distanced less"),
    correct = "Correct!",
    incorrect = "Sorry, that is incorrect. Try again.",
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = T
  )
)

``` 



## Multiple Comparison Tests and Bayes Factors

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

`multcomp` and `DescTools` provide just about all the multiple comparison tests we need.  

DunnettTest is a command from `DescTools`. The structure is pretty similar to other aspects of the ANOVA except we need to explicitly select the control group. I like this better than the `multcomp` command as that specification allows greater flexibility. 
```{r}
DescTools::DunnettTest(x~group,data=xx, control="one")
```

For the Tukey test, we can use `multcomp`. This package is a little fussy. First we need an analysis object. Inside the mcp command we place the name of the factor and then "Tukey" to specify the command. The fussy part is this - for some commands in `multcomp`, if you use data$variable~data$variable when you run the ANOVA, you get an error. It took me months to figure that issue out. Another is that using multcomp::command seems to work only intermittently.  

```{r}
xxxx<-aov(x~group, data=xx)
library(multcomp)
tukey<-glht(xxxx,linfct=mcp(group="Tukey"))
summary(tukey)
```

Finally, for orthogonal contrasts, in this case 2 and 3 vs. 1 and then 2 vs. 3, we need to specific our contrast coding first. I placed that in an object called "mat."

```{r}
mat<-rbind("1 vs 2 and 3"=c(2,-1,-1),
           "2 vs. 3"=c(0, 1, -1))
orthog<-multcomp::glht(xxxx,linfct=mcp(group=mat))
summary(orthog)
```


### Exercise Multiple Comparisons

Using the *covid1F* dataset perform a multiple comparison test that compares each intervention to the control group. Note that there is some difference of opinion on the use of multiple comparison tests in this situation. Some researchers argue that you would never conduct multiple comparisons unless the ominbus test (the F) was statistically significant (i.e., you could reject the null). However, another school of thought (that I happen to agree with) is that if you have a priori predictions about different treatments that you should perform the multiple comparison tests. 

```{r ex2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```

```{r ex2-solution}
DescTools::DunnettTest(SD~group,data=covid1F, control="control")
```

## Graphing Approaches

Graphing with confidence interval error bars can appear challenging, but once you have a working example, you can simply modify it. For the CI, we first summarize our data. This creates a new data file where we calculate the CIs. Once we have calculated the CI, we can graph it. 

The first set of commands use function from `dplyr`. We are creating an object called yy. The command xx %>% passes the name of the dataset to the commands that follow. 

group_by(group) tells R to group your variables using the variable called "group".

summarise mean.x, etc. is creating summary statistics.(it is spelled funny because the package author is from New Zealand). 

The mutate command calculates a new variable that captures the standard error. 

The lower.ci and upper.ci statements calculate the limits of the confidence interval. 

In the ggplot command, we provide the name of the datafile (yy), what goes on each axis, and finally the ci values. The rest does not need  modification



```{r}
yy<-xx %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarise(mean.x = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd.x = sd(x, na.rm = TRUE),
            n.x = n()) %>%
            mutate(se.x = sd.x / sqrt(n.x),
            lower.ci.x = mean.x - qt(1 - (0.05 / 2), n.x - 1) * se.x,
            upper.ci.x = mean.x + qt(1 - (0.05 / 2), n.x - 1) * se.x)

ggplot(yy, aes(x=group, y=mean.x)) + 
    geom_bar(position=position_dodge(), stat="identity") +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=lower.ci.x, ymax=upper.ci.x),
                  width=.2,       
                  position=position_dodge(.9))
```

### Exercise

Adapt the code found above to create a similar graph for your covid1F analyses. 

We'll do this in two steps. First, summarize the data. 

```{r ex3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 8}

```

```{r ex3-solution}
yy<-covid1F %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarise(mean.SD = mean(SD, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd.SD = sd(SD, na.rm = TRUE),
            n.SD = n()) %>%
            mutate(se.SD = sd.SD / sqrt(n.SD),
            lower.ci.SD = mean.SD - qt(1 - (0.05 / 2), n.SD - 1) * se.SD,
            upper.ci.SD = mean.SD + qt(1 - (0.05 / 2), n.SD - 1) * se.SD)
```

Now, make the graph

```{r ex4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 6}

```

```{r ex4-solution}
ggplot(yy, aes(x=group, y=mean.SD)) + 
    geom_bar(position=position_dodge(), stat="identity") +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=lower.ci.SD, ymax=upper.ci.SD),
                  width=.2,       
                  position=position_dodge(.9))
```

## Bayes Factor

The Bayes Factor statistic is pretty straightforward. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

group<-c("one","one","one","two","two","two","three","three","three")
x<-c(2,4,6,4,6,8,6,8,16)
xx<-as.data.frame(cbind(group,x))
xx$group<-as.factor(xx$group)
xx$x<-as.numeric(xx$x)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
anovaBF(x~group, xx)
```

Recall the rough guide to interpreting BF:

BF< 0 	Negative (supports opposite direction)   
0-3 	Anecdotal   
3-10 Substantial  
10-30 Strong  
30-100 Very Strong  
100 + Decisive  

### Exercise

Adapt the code above to the analyses we've carried out in the previous exercises.


```{r ex5, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 1}

```

```{r ex5-solution}
anovaBF(SD~group,covid1F)
```

## Fun Fact!

%>% is called a pipe. It was developed initially for the `magrittr` package which is named after the French Painter Rene Magritte (pictured below).

![](\images\magritte.jpg)

This is a famous painting by the artist.

Which inspired the magrittr sticker design.
