### Learning Objectives

Define the different types of Sums of Square in the within subjects context

Explore links between paired t-test approaches and within subject ANOVA

Explain the conditions for applying the within subjects ANOVA

Compute Sums of Squares, degrees of freedom, Mean Square, and F

Apply the above procedures to making decisions about null hypotheses

Graph and interpret interaction effects 

Use R to compute ANOVA and eta-squared

Apply simple effects tests to formally evaluation interactions

Test assumptions for a within subjects ANOVA

## Data

*West* is the datafile used in exercises. These data examine changes in body image following an intervention from **pre** to **post**. Half of the participants interacted in a bar setting with other participants (the bar was otherwise empty) while naked and the others interacted similarly (in a different room) while clothed **condition**.

*Gaither* examines support for Hillary Clinton before (**pre**) and after (**post**) the 2016 election and how such relationships are affected by participant gender (**gender**).

Both datafiles will be used for several examples. 


### Packages 

This tutorial uses the following new packages:

* `lsr` for effect sizes
* `car` for ANOVA computations
* `ez` for running ANOVA
* `lme4` for linear mixed models

## Video IV: Example and R 

![](https://youtu.be/jZo-UuU1AwM)



## One Factor Within ANOVA in R

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Withing subjects ANOVA requires a bit of data restructuring. For most applications, we use "wide" format wherein every row represents one person and we have a column for each variable. Within subjects approaches generally require "long" format where each person will be in multiple rows (one for each level of the within subject factor).

The first line of code creates an ID number for us. This is essential because it is the only way we know who goes with what. 

The second moves us from wide to long format. key is the name for a new variable that establishes the within subjects condition and value is what we are calling our new DV. -ID makes sure ID is repeated each time a person had data. 

Next we need to make sure all factors are converted to factors and all numeric data are converted to numeric. 

The final line runs the anova using the `ez` package. dv, wid, and within are the relevant variables for analysis.  

```{r}
Gaither$ID<-seq(1:191)
Gaitherlong<-tidyr::gather(Gaither,key="Condition",value="Censor",-ID, -gender)
Gaitherlong$Censor<-as.numeric(Gaitherlong$Censor)
Gaitherlong$Condition<-as.factor(Gaitherlong$Condition)
modelGaither<-ez::ezANOVA(data=Gaitherlong, dv=.(Censor), wid=.(ID), within = .(Condition), type=3, detailed=TRUE)
modelGaither
```

### Exercise 

Using the *West* data, predict attitudes body_image from time. You will need to restructure the data as noted above (there are 51 cases).

```{r ex2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 7}

```

```{r ex2-solution}
load(file="G:/My Drive/ANOVAtutorials/data/West.RData")
West$ID<-seq(1:51)
Westlong<-tidyr::gather(West,key="Time",value="body_image",-ID, -condition)
Westlong$Time<-as.factor(Westlong$Time)
Westlong$body_image<-as.numeric(Westlong$body_image)
modelWest<-ez::ezANOVA(data=Westlong, dv=.(body_image), wid=.(ID), within = .(Time), type=3, detailed=TRUE)
modelWest

```
## Quiz



```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r}
load(file="G:/My Drive/ANOVAtutorials/data/West.RData")
West$ID<-seq(1:51)
Westlong<-tidyr::gather(West,key="Time",value="body_image",-ID, -condition)
Westlong$Time<-as.factor(Westlong$Time)
Westlong$body_image<-as.numeric(Westlong$body_image)
modelWest<-ez::ezANOVA(data=Westlong, dv=.(body_image), wid=.(ID), within = .(Time), type=3, detailed=TRUE)
modelWest
mean(West$pre)
mean(West$post)
```



```{r quiz5, ECHO=F}
learnr::quiz(
 learnr::question("What is your primary conlusion regarding the effect of time?",
    learnr::answer("Body image rose from pretest to posttest"),
    learnr::answer("Body image fell from pretest to posttest"),
    learnr::answer("The posttest happened after the pretest"),
    learnr::answer("Body image did not change",correct=TRUE),  
    correct = "Correct!" ,
    incorrect = "Sorry, that is incorrect. Try again.",
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = T
  )
)

``` 


## Video 5: Sphericity, two within subjects factors, and simple effects

![](https://youtu.be/X3E3b09ENuk)

## Sphericity Exercise

Recall the following decision chart from the ppt slides. 

![](images\sphericity.png)

Using the dataset called *memory* assess the sphericity assumption. These data represent three measurement time points. A pretest, a posttest following implementation of a memory training course, and a three month followup. Variables are **id**, **Memory**, and **Condition**.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Recall the format of the code below. This will automatically generate sphericity values when we have more than three levels. 

```{r}
modelWest<-ez::ezANOVA(data=Westlong, dv=.(body_image), wid=.(ID), within = .(Time), type=3, detailed=TRUE)
modelWest
```

Use the **memory** dataset to address the sphericity assumption. These data are already restructured. 

```{r ex3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 2}

```

```{r ex3-solution}
xx<-ez::ezANOVA(data=memory, dv=.(Memory), wid=.(id), within = .(Condition), type=3, detailed=TRUE)
xx
```

## Quiz

```{r}
xx<-ez::ezANOVA(data=memory, dv=.(Memory), wid=.(id), within = .(Condition), type=3, detailed=TRUE)
xx
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r quiz6, ECHO=F}
learnr::quiz(
 learnr::question("Based on the sphericity value, which of the adjustments would you choose (leave sample size out of the decision for now)",
    learnr::answer("No adjustment"),
    learnr::answer("Greenhouse-Geisser for one and Hyuhn-Feldt for the other"),
    learnr::answer("No adjustment needed"),
    learnr::answer("Hyuhn-Feldt",correct=TRUE),  
    correct = "Correct!" ,
    incorrect = "Sorry, that is incorrect. Try again.",
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = T
  ),
  learnr::question("What is your conclusion about the effect of time on risk?",
    learnr::answer("Risk changes over time"),
    learnr::answer("Time changes over risk"),
    learnr::answer("Risk does not change over time",correct=TRUE),  
    correct = "Correct!" ,
    incorrect = "Sorry, that is incorrect. Try again.",
    random_answer_order = TRUE,
    allow_retry = T
  )
)

``` 

## Doubly Within with Simple effects in R

Returning to the video example, we see the code is simply expanded to include a second factor. Simple effects tests are most easily conducted on the original data in wide format. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
options(contrasts=c("contr.helmert", "contr.poly"))
xx<-ez::ezANOVA(data=long2F, dv=.(risk), wid=.(id), within = .(time,condom), type=3, detailed=TRUE)
xx
t.test(twofactorwithin$t1c1,twofactorwithin$t1c2, paired=TRUE)
cohensD(twofactorwithin$t1c1,twofactorwithin$t1c2,method="paired")
t.test(twofactorwithin$t2c1,twofactorwithin$t2c2, paired=TRUE)
cohensD(twofactorwithin$t2c1,twofactorwithin$t2c2,method="paired")
t.test(twofactorwithin$t3c1,twofactorwithin$t3c2, paired=TRUE)
cohensD(twofactorwithin$t3c1,twofactorwithin$t3c2,method="paired")
t.test(twofactorwithin$t4c1,twofactorwithin$t4c2, paired=TRUE)
cohensD(twofactorwithin$t4c1,twofactorwithin$t4c2,method="paired")
```


## Video 6: Linear Mixed Models

![](https://youtu.be/G0X6xC2EOag)

## LMM with R

To run linear mixed models, we can use the `nlme` package (`lme4` is another popular one). The basic analysis structure involves running a baseline (a.k.a. intercept only model) that has no factors in it, running a model with your factor(s), and then comparing the models to address significance. 

```{r}
library(nlme)
model1_baseline<-lme(risk~1, random = ~1|id/time, data=long2F,method="ML")
model1_time<-lme(risk~time, random = ~1|id/time, data=long2F,method="ML")
print(anova(model1_baseline,model1_time))
```

### Exercise

Using the **memory** dataset, run a linear mixed model. 

```{r ex4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 4}

```

```{r ex4-solution}
library(nlme)
model1_baseline<-lme(Memory~1, random = ~1|id/Condition, data=memory,method="ML")
model1_Condition<-lme(Memory~Condition, random = ~1|id/Condition, data=memory,method="ML")
print(anova(model1_baseline,model1_Condition))
```
