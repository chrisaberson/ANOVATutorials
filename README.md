If this doesnâ€™t work, you likely need to update your rtools. Go to
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/</a>
and download the most recent version (for your platform (Note: Rtools is
just for Windows, I am looking into other platforms). You may also, on
Mac OS have to install the backports package.
